This is a learning plan for mastering Git and GitHub. The goal is to understand version control concepts, efficiently manage code repositories, and collaborate on software development projects. The topics include the basics of Git, understanding repositories, and key commands like init, add, commit, and push. You'll learn about branching, merging, resolving conflicts, and best practices for writing commit messages.

For GitHub, the focus will be on setting up a GitHub account, creating and managing repositories, collaborating using pull requests, and handling issues and discussions. Additional concepts include working with GitHub Pages for hosting, using GitHub Actions for automation, and managing access and permissions for teams.

The tools used are Git (installed locally) and the GitHub platform via its web interface, GitHub Desktop, or Git CLI. The learning timeline involves starting with local repository creation, moving to remote repository management, practicing collaboration workflows, and eventually automating tasks with GitHub Actions. Progress will be tracked by completing hands-on activities like creating repositories, pushing code, resolving merge conflicts, and collaborating on a project. The ultimate aim is to gain proficiency in version control and leverage Git and GitHub for professional software development.
